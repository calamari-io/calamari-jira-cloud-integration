# Calamari - Jira integration
This integration is syncing absences between Calamari and Jira Tempo.

## Disclaimer
This repository is a fork of excellent work done by [Tenesys](https://tenesys.io) team in  [calamari-jira-integration](https://github.com/tenesys/calamari-jira-integration) repository. 

## Deployment

### Build 
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt -t build
cp -r src build
cd build
zip -r ../build.zip .
```

### Upload to AWS S3 bucket
You can use AWS Management Console or `awscli`

```
aws s3 cp build.zip s3://<yourbucketname>/
```

### Deploy using Cloudformation template
Deploy using the cloud formation template provided in `cloudformation/lambda.yml`. All the configuration is done using CloudFormation parameters and can be keept in SSM Parameter Store or Lambda function environment variables.

| Parameter Name | Description | Example | Default value |
| :------------- | :---------- | :------ | :------------ |
| `S3Bucket` | S3 bucket that will contain Lambda code. It needs to be in the same region as Lambda. | my-lambda-code-bucket | N/A |
| `S3BucketKey` | Path to the zip.ed Lambda code | `build.zip` or `somedirectory/build.zip` | `build.zip` | 
| `LambdaHandlerPath` | Default lambda function. Change the default value ONLY if you have modified the code. | `src/main.lambda_handler` | `src/main.lambda_handler` |
| `UseSSMParameterStore` | Set to `True` if you want to keep all Lambda configurations in SSM Parameter Store. Otherwise configuration will be stored in Lambda environment variables | `True` | `False` |
| `SSMParameterStorePrefix` | Is used if `UseSSMParameterStore` is set to `True`. Define the prefix for configuration stored in SSM Parameter store. | `/my-configuration-prefix` | `/calamari-jira-cloud-integration` |
| `AbsenceSyncCrontabDefinition` | Cron-based schedule definition for absence (Calamari -> Tempo) synchronization. More information can be found [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-scheduled-rule-pattern.html). Leave empty to disable this type of synchronization. | `*/3 * * * ? *` (every 3 minutes) | `* 20 * * ? *` (every day at 8 p.m.) |
| `TimesheetSyncCrontabDefinition` | Cron-based schedule definition for timesheet (Tempo -> Calamari) synchronization. More information can be found [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-scheduled-rule-pattern.html). Leave empty to disable this type of synchronization. | `*/3 * * * ? *` (every 3 minutes) | `* 20 * * ? *` (every day at 8 p.m.) |
| `CalamariAbsenceIgnoredEmployees` | Comma-separated list of employees email that should be ignored during synchronization. Leave default value if none. | `my.employee@mycompany.org` | `employee@company.com` |
| `CalamariAbsenceIgnoredTypes` | Comma-separated list of calamari.io absence types that should be ignored during synchronization. (Calamari -> Tempo) | `Remote work` | `Praca zdalna,Delegacja` |
| `CalamariApiToken` | calamari.io API token. More information can be found [here](https://help.calamari.io/en/articles/24539-what-is-the-api-key-for-and-where-can-i-find-it). | N/A | N/A |
| `CalamariApiUrl` | Your dedicated calamari API Base URL. | https://mycompany.calamari.io | N/A |
| `CalamariTimesheetContractTypes` | Comma-separated list of contract types. Only users with those contract type(s) will have work synchronized (Tempo -> Calamari). | `Umowa o pracę - 26 dni` | `Umowa o pracę - 26 dni` |
| `JiraAbsenceIssue` | Jira issue name to store absences as Tempo work logs | `LEAVE-1` | N/A |
| `JiraAbsenceWorklogDescription` | Description that will be used for all Tempo work logs. | `Holiday/Vacation/Leave` | N/A |
| `JiraApiUrl` | Jira API URL | `https://my-company.atlassian.net` | N/A |
| `JiraApiToken` | Jira API token [https//id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens). | N/A | N/A |
| `JiraApiUser` | Jira API user (email). It need to have permission to log work as other users and permission to issue selected in `JiraAbsenceIssue` | N/A | N/A |
| `TempoApiToken` | Tempo API token. Can be generated in Tempo Configuration -> Data Access -> API Integration. Leave empty for native Jira worklogs. | N/A | N/A |
| `DaysAfter` | How many days in the past should be take into consideration during the synchronization process. Maximum value is 90. | `14` | `30` | 
| `DaysBefore` | How many days in the future should be taken into consideration during synchronization process. Maximum value is 90. | `14` | `30` | 
| `Debug` | Set to 1 to enable Lambda debug logging (CloudWatch Logs) | `1` | `0` |

## How it works

## Absence sync (Calamari -> Jira)
Synchronization will take approved absences from Calamari and report them as work logs in Tempo. Abseces are stored as Tempo work logs in issue defined by `JiraAbsenceIssue`. During the synchronization, all absences are taken into account except for:
*  ignored employees (`CalamariAbsenceIgnoredEmployees`)
*  ignored absence types (`CalamariAbsenceIgnoredTypes`)

Lambda will detect conflicting work logs and log them with level WARNING to CloudWatch Logs.

## Timesheet sync (Jira -> Calamari)
Synchronization will takes Tempo work logs and add them as shifts in calamari. They will be added only for employees with selected contract type(s) (`CalamariTimesheetContractTypes`). 

All conflicts will be overwritten by data from Tempo.
